Command list and it's description for the Menu driven Polynomial ADT Program.
The user has two polynomials to use: poly1 and poly2. The user needs to mention the polynomial to be modified along with the command as mentioned in cmd format.
There is also a 3rd polynomial: poly3 - It is used for merge command to store the merged polynomial of poly1, poly2 and can only be used through display and change coeff command(only after execution of add-poly / sub-poly cmd).

init - initializes an polynomial.
format: init poly1

change-coeff - changes the coefiicient of given exponent.
format: insert poly1

display - displays given polynomial.(does not print anything if all coefficients are 0)
format: display poly1

add-poly - adds two polynomials, stores result into 3rd polynomial.
format: add-poly

sub-poly - subtracts two polynomials, stores result into 3rd polynomial.
format: sub-poly

exit - to exit the program.
